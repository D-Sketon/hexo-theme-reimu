## Uses

<details>
<summary>Basic structure</summary>

### Basic structure

For correct display, please refer to `_example` and create separate `_data`, `about` and `friend` folders in `source`

#### \_data

- The `avatar` folder stores the author's avatar, named `avatar.webp` by default, and can be configured in the inner `_config.yml` as follows

```yaml
avatar: "avatar.webp"
```

- The `covers` folder stores the article covers
- The `covers.yml` file stores the article cover urls

#### about

`index.md` as the **about** page

#### friend

`index.md` as the **friends** page, fill in `_data.yml` with friend information to display the corresponding friend card on the page

</details>
<details>
<summary>Cover, banner and favicon</summary>

### Cover, banner and favicon

#### Cover

The logic for displaying the cover is as follows

- If the article's Front matter contains the url for cover, the article's header image and home page thumbnails display that url

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: https://example.com
---
```

- If the article's Front matter contains cover as `false`, the article doesn't show the header image (it's still a random image on the front page)

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: false
---
```

- If the article's Front matter contains cover as `rgb(xxx,xxx,xxx)`, the article's header image is the corresponding gradient solid color (still a random image on the front page)

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: rgb(255,117,117)
---
```

- Otherwise, look for the `covers` folder and `covers.yml` and pick a random image from it
- If none of these files exist, display the banner

#### banner

The banner is stored in `themes/reimu/source/images/banner.webp` and can be modified in the inner `_config.yml`

```yaml
banner: "/images/banner.webp"
```

#### favicon

The favicon is stored in `themes/reimu/source/images/favicon.ico`，and can be modified in the inner `_config.yml`

```yaml
favicon: "/images/favicon.ico"
```

#### topped

Add `sticky: true` to the article's Front-matter

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
sticky: true
---
```

<details>
<summary>Code highlighting</summary>

### Code highlighting

(<7.0.0)

```yaml

  enable: true
  wrap: true
  hljs: false
